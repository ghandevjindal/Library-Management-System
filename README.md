Library Management System (LMS) in C++
This project is a simple console-based Library Management System implemented in C++. It allows users to manage books and patrons in a library setting through various operations such as adding books, checking out books, returning books, and displaying information.

Features
Add Books: Add new books to the library catalog.
Display Books: View the list of available books with their details.
Check Out Books: Allow patrons to borrow books from the library.
Return Books: Process the return of borrowed books.
Error Handling: Basic error handling for invalid operations (e.g., attempting to check out a book that is already checked out).
Implementation Details
Classes
Book Class:

Represents a book with attributes such as title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
Includes methods to display book information, check availability, and modify availability.
Library Class:

Manages a collection of Book objects.
Provides methods to add books, display the library catalog, check out books, and return books.
Main Program (main.cpp)
Demonstrates the usage of the Book and Library classes.
Implements a basic menu-driven interface for interacting with the library system.
Files
main.cpp: Contains the main program logic where sample books are added, operations are performed, and results are displayed.
Book.h, Book.cpp: Header and implementation files for the Book class.
Library.h, Library.cpp: Header and implementation files for the Library class.
Usage
Compilation: Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).

bash
Copy code
g++ main.cpp Book.cpp Library.cpp -o library_management
Execution: Run the compiled executable to start the program.

bash
Copy code
./library_management
Menu Options: Use the console-based menu to perform various operations like adding books, checking out books, and returning books.
